## PDF Tips

* [UIImage-PDF](https://github.com/mindbrix/UIImage-PDF) didn't like the PDF file that Adobe Illustrator made. So, instead of saving to PDF, save it to EPS, open it in Preview, then save it to PDF.
* Use Panic's [ShrinkIt](http://www.panic.com/blog/shrinkit-1-2/) to reduce the PDF size.
